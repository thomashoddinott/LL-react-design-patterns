# Notes
General definition of design patterns:
- effective solutions to common application-development challenges 
- not the "Gang of Four" patterns 

**Layout Components:**

In a nutshell, separate layout from content

**Container Components:**

Let the container load the data (axios) and pass it to child components. Or, "Our components shouldn't know where their data is coming from."
